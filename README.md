## Context
This project aims to showcase my network design capabilities by addressing a real-world challenge. Among the proposed challenges, I've chosen the "Step Detection" topic, focusing on detecting footsteps based on data collected from an ankle-worn inertial sensor. The core task involves time series classification. The primary objectives include choosing and constructing an appropriate neural network for generating feature matrices and analyzing its predictive abilities on time series data.

## Objectives
